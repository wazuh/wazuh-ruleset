# 1.1.1.8 FAT: filesystem
  - id: 5667 
    title: "Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is disabled"
    description: "The FAT filesystem format is primarily used on older windows systems and portable USB drives or flash modules. It comes in three types FAT12 , FAT16 , and FAT32 all of which are supported by the vfat kernel module."
    rationale: "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it."
    remediation: "Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line: install vfat /bin/true. Run the following command to unload the vfat module: rmmod vfat"

  # 1.1.2 /tmp: partition
  - id: 5668 
    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /tmp"
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /tmp. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition for /tmp if not using tmpfs. Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting:  # systemctl unmask tmp.mount    # systemctl enable tmp.mount           Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount: [Mount]  What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid"

# 1.2.5 Disable the rhnsd Daemon (Not Scored)
  - id: 5674 
    title: "Disable the rhnsd Daemon"
    description: "The rhnsd daemon polls the Red Hat Network web site for scheduled actions and, if there are, executes those actions."
    rationale: "Patch management policies may require that organizations test the impact of a patch before it is deployed in a production environment. Having patches automatically deployed could have a negative impact on the environment. It is best to not allow an action by default but only after appropriate consideration has been made. It is recommended that the service be disabled unless the risk is understood and accepted or you are running your own satellite . This item is not scored because organizations may have addressed the risk."

    description: "Configure SELinux to meet or exceed the default targeted policy, which constrains daemons and system software only."
    rationale: "Security configuration requirements vary from site to site. Some sites may mandate a policy that is stricter than the default policy, which is perfectly acceptable. This item is intended to ensure that at least the default recommendations are met."

    description: "Daemons that are not defined in SELinux policy will inherit the security context of their parent process."
    rationale: "Since daemons are launched and descend from the init process, they will inherit the security context label initrc_t . This could cause the unintended consequence of giving the process more permission than it requires."
    remediation: "Investigate any unconfined daemons found during the audit action. They may need to have an existing security context assigned to them or a policy built for them."

    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a shell could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's shell session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening."
