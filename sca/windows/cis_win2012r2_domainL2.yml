    title: "Ensure 'Devices: Prevent users from installing printer drivers' is set to 'Enabled'"
    description: "For a computer to print to a shared printer, the driver for that shared printer must be installed on the local computer. This security setting determines who is allowed to install a printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. Note: This setting does not affect the ability to add a local printer. This setting does not affect Administrators."
    rationale: "It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on their own workstations. However, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do so on servers, because printer driver installation on a server may unintentionally cause the computer to become less stable. A malicious user could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver. It is feasible for an attacker to disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver. The program may appear to users as if they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash malicious code on your computer network."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options\\Devices: Prevent users from installing printer drivers."

A cloud is a set of peer computers that can communicate with each other by using the same IPv6 scope.

    title: "Disable IPv6 (Ensure TCPIP6 Parameter 'DisabledComponents' is set to '0xff (255)')"
    description: "Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange information over the Internet and over home and business networks. IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively. The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)"
    rationale: "Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components reduces a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff (255) (DWORD): HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TCPIP6\\Parameters:DisabledComponents. Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted. Note #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry value, a custom .ADM template (Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm) is provided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not \"undo\" the change once applied. Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to change the registry value to the opposite state."
