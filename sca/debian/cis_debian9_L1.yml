# 2 Filesystem Configuration
  - id: 3005
    title: "Ensure /tmp is configured"
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."

Example: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 or Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting: systemctl unmask tmp.mount systemctl enable tmp.mount Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount"

# 1.5 Additional Process Hardening

    description: "A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be overridden by the user."
    rationale: "Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5) ). In addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from dumping core."
    remediation: "Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf or a /etc/security/limits.d/* file: * hard core 0 Set the following parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file: fs.suid_dumpable = 0 Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter: # sysctl -w fs.suid_dumpable=0"

    title: "Ensure local login warning banner is configured properly"
    description: "The contents of the /etc/issue file are displayed to users prior to login for local terminals. Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release and patch level upon logging in to the system. This information can be useful to developers who are developing software for a particular OS platform. If mingetty(8) supports the following options, they display operating system information: \\m - machine architecture \\r - operating system release \\s - operating system name \\v - operating system version"
    rationale: "Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the system and any monitoring policies that are in place. Displaying OS and patch level information in login banners also has the side effect of providing detailed system information to attackers attempting to target specific exploits of a system. Authorized users can easily get this information by running the \" uname -a \" command once they have logged in."

    description: "Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter to 1 forces the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if the packet was valid. Essentially, with reverse path filtering, if the return packet does not go out the same interface that the corresponding source packet came from, the packet is dropped (and logged if log_martians is set)."
    rationale: Setting these flags is a good way to deter attackers from sending your system bogus packets that cannot be responded to. One instance where this feature breaks down is if asymmetrical routing is employed. This would occur when using dynamic routing protocols (bgp, ospf, etc) on your system.

    title: "Ensure TCP SYN Cookies is enabled"
    description: "When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue."
    rationale: "Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake.

For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening. While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy.
