Many lists are included including filesystem types, services, clients, and network protocols. Not all items in these lists are guaranteed to exist on all distributions and additional similar items may exist which should be considered in addition to those explicitly mentioned."

# Section 1.1 - Filesystem Configuration
 - id: 5000
   title: "Ensure /tmp is configured"
   description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
   rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
   remediation: "Configure /etc/fstab as appropiate or enable systemd /tmp mounting and edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount."

   title: "Ensure source routed packets are not accepted"
   description: "In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used."
   rationale: "Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route, net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route, net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route and net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing."
   remediation: "Set the following parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file: net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0, net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0, net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0, net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0"

   title: "Ensure broadcast ICMP requests are ignored"
   description: "Setting net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts to 1 will cause the system to ignore all ICMP echo and timestamp requests to broadcast and multicast addresses."
   rationale: "Accepting ICMP echo and timestamp requests with broadcast or multicast destinations for your network could be used to trick your host into starting (or participating) in a Smurf attack. A Smurf attack relies on an attacker sending large amounts of ICMP broadcast messages with a spoofed source address. All hosts receiving this message and responding would send echo-reply messages back to the spoofed address, which is probably not routable. If many hosts respond to the packets, the amount of traffic on the network could be significantly multiplied."
