    title: "SSH Hardening: Port should not be 22"
    description: "The ssh daemon should not be listening on port 22 (the default value) for incoming connections."
    rationale: "Changing the default port you may reduce the number of successful attacks from zombie bots, an attacker or bot doing port-scanning can quickly identify your SSH port."
    remediation: "Change the Port option value in the sshd_config file."

    title: "SSH Hardening: Protocol should be set to 2"
    description: "The SSH protocol should not be 1."
    rationale: "The Protocol parameter dictates which version of the SSH communication and encryption protocols are in use. Version 1 of the SSH protocol has weaknesses."
    remediation: "Change the Protocol option value in the sshd_config file."

    title: "SSH Hardening: Root account should not be able to log in"
    description: "The option PermitRootLogin should be set to no."
    rationale: "The option PermitRootLogin specifies whether root can log in using ssh. If you want log in as root, you should use the option \"Match\" and restrict it to a few IP addresses."
    remediation: "Change the PermitRootLogin option value in the sshd_config file."
    condition: all

  - id: 4003
    title: "SSH Hardening: No Public Key authentication"
    description: "The option PubkeyAuthentication should be set yes."
    rationale: "Access only by public key. Generally people will use weak passwords and have poor password practices. Keys are considered stronger than password."
    remediation: "Change the PubkeyAuthentication option value in the sshd_config file."
    compliance:

    description: "The option PasswordAuthentication should be set to no."
    rationale: "The option PasswordAuthentication specifies whether we should use password-based authentication. Use public key authentication instead of passwords."
    remediation: "Change the PasswordAuthentication option value in the sshd_config file."

  - id: 4005
    title: "SSH Hardening: Empty passwords should not be allowed"
    description: "The option PermitEmptyPasswords should be set to no."
    rationale: "The option PermitEmptyPasswords specifies whether the server allows logging in to accounts with a null password. Accounts with null passwords are a bad practice."
    remediation: "Change the PermitEmptyPasswords option value in the sshd_config file."
    compliance:
      - pci_dss: ["2.2.4"]

    title: "SSH Hardening: Rhost or shost should not be used for authentication"
    description: "The option IgnoreRhosts should be set to yes."
    rationale: "The option IgnoreRhosts specifies whether rhosts or shosts files should not be used in authentication. For security reasons it is recommended to no use rhosts or shosts files for authentication."
    remediation: "Change the IgnoreRhosts option value in the sshd_config file."
    compliance:
      - pci_dss: ["2.2.4"]

  - id: 4007
    title: "SSH Hardening: Grace Time should be one minute or less."
    description: "The option LoginGraceTime should be set to 60 or less."
    rationale: "The option LoginGraceTime specifies how long in seconds after a connection request the server will wait before disconnecting if the user has not successfully logged in. 30 seconds is the recommended time for avoiding open connections without authenticate."
    remediation: "Change the LoginGraceTime option value in the sshd_config file."
    compliance:

  - id: 4008
    title: "SSH Hardening: Wrong Maximum number of authentication attempts"
    description: "The option MaxAuthTries should be set to 4 or less."
    rationale: "The MaxAuthTries parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts permitted per connection. Once the number of failures reaches half this value, additional failures are logged. This should be set to 4."
    remediation: "Change the MaxAuthTries option value in the sshd_config file."

    title: "SSH Hardening: Ensure SSH HostbasedAuthentication is disabled"
    description: "The HostbasedAuthentication parameter specifies if authentication is allowed through trusted hosts via the user of .rhosts , or /etc/hosts.equiv , along with successful public key client host authentication. This option only applies to SSH Protocol Version 2."
    rationale: "Even though the .rhosts files are ineffective if support is disabled in /etc/pam.conf, disabling the ability to use .rhosts files in SSH provides an additional layer of protection."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: HostbasedAuthentication no"

    rationale: "Strong passwords protect systems from being hacked through brute force methods."
