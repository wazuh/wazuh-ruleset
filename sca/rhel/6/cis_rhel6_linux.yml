    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /tmp"
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code."

# 5.2.2 Set SSH Protocol to 2 (Scored)
  - id: 5048
    title: "Ensure SSH Protocol is set to 2"
    description: "SSH supports two different and incompatible protocols: SSH1 and SSH2. SSH1 was the original protocol and was subject to security issues. SSH2 is more advanced and secure."
    rationale: "SSH v1 suffers from insecurities that do not affect SSH v2."

# 5.2.3 Set LogLevel to INFO (Scored)
  - id: 5049
    title: "Ensure SSH LogLevel is set to INFO"
    description: "The INFO parameter specifies that login and logout activity will be logged."
    rationale: "SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. DEBUG is specifically not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information."

# 5.2.5 Set SSH MaxAuthTries to 4 or Less (Scored)
  - id: 5050
    title: "Ensure SSH MaxAuthTries is set to 4 or less"
    description: "The MaxAuthTries parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts permitted per connection. When the login failure count reaches half the number, error messages will be written to the syslog file detailing the login failure."
    rationale: "Setting the MaxAuthTries parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to the SSH server. While the recommended setting is 4, set the number based on site policy."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: MaxAuthTries 4"

# 5.2.6 Set SSH IgnoreRhosts to Yes (Scored)
  - id: 5051
    title: "Ensure SSH IgnoreRhosts is enabled"
    description: "The IgnoreRhosts parameter specifies that .rhosts and .shosts files will not be used in RhostsRSAAuthentication or HostbasedAuthentication."

# 5.2.7 Set SSH HostbasedAuthentication to No (Scored)
  - id: 5052
    title: "Ensure SSH HostbasedAuthentication is disabled"
    description: "The HostbasedAuthentication parameter specifies if authentication is allowed through trusted hosts via the user of .rhosts , or /etc/hosts.equiv, along with successful public key client host authentication. This option only applies to SSH Protocol Version 2."
    rationale: "Even though the .rhosts files are ineffective if support is disabled in /etc/pam.conf, disabling the ability to use .rhosts files in SSH provides an additional layer of protection."

# 5.2.8 Disable SSH Root Login (Scored)
  - id: 5053
    title: "Ensure SSH root login is disabled"
    description: "The PermitRootLogin parameter specifies if the root user can log in using ssh(1). The default is no."
    rationale: "Disallowing root logins over SSH requires system admins to authenticate using their own individual account, then escalating to root via sudo or su . This in turn limits opportunity for non-repudiation and provides a clear audit trail in the event of a security incident"

# 5.2.9 Set SSH PermitEmptyPasswords to No (Scored)
  - id: 5054
    title: "Ensure SSH PermitEmptyPasswords is disabled"
    description: "The PermitEmptyPasswords parameter specifies if the SSH server allows login to accounts with empty password strings."
    rationale: "Disallowing remote shell access to accounts that have an empty password reduces the probability of unauthorized access to the system"
