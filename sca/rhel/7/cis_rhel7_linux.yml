    rationale: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated.

    description: "A network port is identified by its number, the associated IP address, and the type of the communication protocol such as TCP or UDP.A listening port is a network port on which an application or process listens on, acting as a communication endpoint. Each listening port can be open or closed (filtered) using a firewall. In general terms, an open port is a network port that accepts incoming packets from remote locations"

These services should be reviewed, and if not required, the service should be stopped, and the package containing the service should be removed. If required packages have a dependency, the service should be stopped and masked to reduce the attack surface of the system."

In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used."

Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems.

    rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw-rw-). The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umaskare cleared in the resulting file mode."
    rationale: "Setting a very secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice about their file permissions. A default umask setting of 077 causes files and directories created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system.

    description: "Local accounts can uses shadowed passwords. With shadowed passwords, The passwords are saved in shadow password file, /etc/shadow, encrypted by a salted one-way hash. Accounts with a shadowed password have an xin the second field in /etc/passwd."
    rationale: "The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack."
    remediation: "f any accounts in the /etc/passwdfile do not have a single x in the password field, run the following command to set these accounts to use shadowed passwords:# sed -e 's/^\\([a-zA-Z0-9_]*\\):[^:]*:/\\1:x:/' -i /etc/passwdInvestigate to determine if the account is logged in and what it is being used for, to determine if it needs to be forced off."

    description: "An account with an empty password field means that anybody may log in as that user without providing a password."
    rationale: "All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user."
    remediation: "If any accounts in the /etc/shadow file do not have a password, run the following command to lock the account until it can be determined why it does not have a password: passwd -l <username> || Also, check to see if the account is logged in and investigate what it is being used for to determine if it needs to be forced off."

# 6.2.18 Ensure shadow group is empty (Automated)
  - id: 4696 
    title: "Ensure shadow group is empty"
    description: "The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability to read the /etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group"
    rationale: "Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily runa password cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security information that is stored in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert additional user accounts."
