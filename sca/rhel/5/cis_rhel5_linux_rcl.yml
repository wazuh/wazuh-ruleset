   rationale: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code."

   title: "Disable SSH Root Login"
   description: "The PermitRootLogin parameter specifies if the root user can log in using ssh(1) . The default is no."
   rationale: "Disallowing root logins over SSH requires server admins to authenticate using their own individual account, then escalating to root via sudo or su . This in turn limits opportunity for non-repudiation and provides a clear audit trail in the event of a security incident"
   remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: PermitRootLogin no"

   title: "Set SSH PermitEmptyPasswords to No"
   description: "The PermitEmptyPasswords parameter specifies if the server allows login to accounts with empty password strings."
   rationale: "Disallowing remote shell access to accounts that have an empty password reduces the probability of unauthorized access to the system"

   description: "Any account with UID 0 has superuser privileges on the system."
   rationale: "This access must be limited to only the default root account and only from the system console. Administrative access must be through an unprivileged account using an approved mechanism as noted in Item 7.5 Restrict root Login to System Console."
